			<h2>
				So why did I decide to try all the baseball nacho helmets?
			</h2>
			<p>My boyfriend and I love baseball. I mean <em>love</em> baseball. We go to at least 10 games a year and recently moved near White Sox Park. (#iwillnevercallitguaranteedratefield <-- follow on Instagram). </p>
			<p>In fact one of our first dates was a baseball game and we shared a nacho helmet. It seemed really silly, but I wondered how many other baseball stadiums have them. As the conversation continued (with a few more Old Styles, too), we decided it would be fun to try to collect them from every stadium that offered one.</p>
			<p>This is still a work in progress, but we're trying! Check back for updates!</p>

					<h3>#1. Chicago White Sox</h3>

					<h4>Overall Taste Score: 10/10</h4>
					<h4>Texture: 10/10</h4>
					<p>Out of the nacho helmets thus far, the Chicago White Sox one leads by leaps and bounds. Firstly, they use shredded cheese rather than the liquid nacho cheese. This helps it from becoming an overall mushy mess within the first 10 minues. Additionally, they add vegetables on top to add crunch and freshness. You can get them with either shredded chicken, shredded pork, or ground beef. All options are great, but ground beef is our favorite. From the first chip to the last, the White Sox nacho helmet has never disappointed. </p>
