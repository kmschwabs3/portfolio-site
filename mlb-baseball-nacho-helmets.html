			<h2>
				So why did I decide to try all the baseball nacho helmets?
			</h2>
			<p>My boyfriend and I love baseball. I mean <em>love</em> baseball. We go to at least 10 games a year and recently moved near White Sox Park. (#iwillnevercallitguaranteedratefield <-- follow on Instagram). </p>
			<p>In fact one of our first dates was a baseball game and we shared a nacho helmet. It seemed really silly, but I wondered how many other baseball stadiums have them. As the conversation continued (with a few more Old Styles, too), we decided it would be fun to try to collect them from every stadium that offered one.</p>
			<p>This is still a work in progress, but we're trying! Check back for updates!</p>

			                <td class="highlights">Out of the nacho helmets thus far, the Chicago White Sox one leads by leaps and bounds. Firstly, they use shredded cheese rather than the liquid nacho cheese. This helps it from becoming an overall mushy mess within the first 10 minues. Additionally, they add vegetables on top to add crunch and freshness. You can get them with either shredded chicken, shredded pork, or ground beef. All options are great, but ground beef is our favorite. From the first chip to the last, the White Sox nacho helmet has never disappointed.</td>

			                <td class="team">Milwaukee Brewers</td>
			                <td class="highlights">The Brewers have our second favorite helmet of the stadiums so far. Filled with ground beef, nacho cheese, sour cream, and pickeled jalpenos, this one just edged out the Cardinals because of the sour cream. I feel like the more toppings you get the better it is, and sour cream is a nice tang that helps cut the richness of the beef and cheese. The downfall, like other later in the list, is the nacho cheese and ground beef make the chips soggy after a while.</td>

			                <td class="team">St. Louis Cardinals</td>
			                <td class="highlights">The Cardinals nacho helmet was also super tasty. Theirs was more of a stadium nacho with ground beef, nacho cheese, salsa, and pickeled jalapenos on top. The major downfall of this one, and other nacho helmets though, is the liquid nacho cheese. The longer you have it, the mushier the chips get. I love crispy nacho chips for texture, so once that's gone I kind of lose interest. Overall, still a top pick and was worth the money.</td>
